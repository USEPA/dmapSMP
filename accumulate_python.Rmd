Users, please note that this process can only be run if the shade_model_preprocessing.Rmd
process has been run through the BFW calculation step, and a HUC4 geodatabase was
downloaded as a part of that process. 


```{r}
annual_precip <- get_annual_precip(gdb_path, nhdr_lines)

write_csv(annual_precip, "python/annual_precip.csv")
```

```{r}
metric <- "PrecipMM01"
input_data <- "edges4.csv"
input_relshpCSV <- "relationships2.csv"
```

```{r}
source_python("python/test_fun.py")
accumulate_precip(metric, input_data, input_relshpCSV)
```
