Description: The Shade Model Preprocessing tool is a process that prepares 
  NHDPlus HR flowline datasets for processing in RShade. It does this by taking 
  the spatial data, calculating new columns, and exporting to a csv that can be 
  input directly into RShade. For instructions on how to use this process, please 
  see the shade_model_preprocessing.Rmd included in this repository.
